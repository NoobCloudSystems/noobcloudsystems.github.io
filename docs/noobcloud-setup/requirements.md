# Requirements

NoobCloud doesn't have very special requirements. You need `Java 17` installed on your machine and eventually `screen` when running on Linux.
A minimum of 256 MB of RAM are recommended.

If you have everything installed, you can proceed to the [installation](/docs/noobcloud-setup/installation).
