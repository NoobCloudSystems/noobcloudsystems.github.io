# SocialSystem

**GitHub:** https://github.com/NoobCloudSystems/SocialSystem

## Description

SocialSystem is a NoobCloud compatible friends and party system/plugin for Velocity. It comes with an API([JavaDocs](https://docs.luccboy.tk/socialsystem)) and has all features that other friends/party plugins have.
It requires a sql database because the plugin stores all its data there.
On startup the plugin creates a `messages` folder with a german and english config. You can select the language in the `config.json` and change your sql login data there.
You can also create your own message config in any other language.

## Commands

- `/friends`
- `/msg`
- `/reply`
