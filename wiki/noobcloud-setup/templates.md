# Templates

NoobCloud has a simple template-system, it is used as follows:

## Template-folders

All templates are saved in the `templates` folder. Inside you will find a `game` and a `proxy` folder. The `game`-folder contains the templates for all game groups and the
`proxy`-folder contains the templates for all proxy groups. Inside these both folders, there are again folders named by the groups you created, here you can place your 
plugins/worlds and other files which will then be copied and loaded when a server is started.

## Global templates

At this time, global templates are not available. This feature will be added as soon as possible.
